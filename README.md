# OBBApp
OurBrainBank is a non-profit, innovative and patient-led movement designed to move glioblastoma (GBM) from terminal to treatable, powered by patients. Our key tool is our free app. It enables people affected by GBM to manage their disease by tracking their symptomsâ€”an essential path to coping and surviving. It also allows patients to donate their data to medical researchers. Data is vital in the search for new life-saving treatments. This interactive element of the app allows you to see how everyone using the app is doing, so you can compare symptoms, demographic information, and even see where everyone is located.
